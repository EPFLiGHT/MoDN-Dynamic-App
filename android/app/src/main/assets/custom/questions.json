Remove the dipstick from the solution and place it in a horizontal position.\n\nINTERPRETATION:\n-        Read results within 5 minutes. Do not pay attention to any lines appearing later than 5 minutes. \n-        The red (control) line confirms the correct performance of the test.\n-        If, in addition to the red control line there are\no        no blue lines, the serum CRP concentration of the sample is <10 mg/l\no        one blue line, the serum CRP concentration is 10-40 mg/l\no        two blue lines, the serum CRP concentration is 40-80 mg/l\no        three blue lines, the serum CRP concentration is >80 mg/l\n-        If the red (control) line does not appear, the test is invalid and the test must be performed again.\n-        Document the results of the test as per usual health facility procedures with the result CRP <10mg/l, CRP 10-40mg/l, or CRP >40- <79mg/l, or >80mg/l\"",

The fold of the skin should be in a line up and down the child’s body.\n3.PICK UP all the layers of skin and the tissue underneath them.\n4.     HOLD the pinch for one second. Then release it.\n5.

If the skin stays up for even a brief time after you release it, decide that the skin pinch goes back slowly. \n\nNOTE: The skin pinch test is not always an accurate sign. In a child with severe malnutrition, the skin may go back slowly even if the child is not dehydrated.

If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not have a stiff neck.\n\nIf you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw the child’s attention to his umbilicus or toes. For example, you can shine a flashlight on his toes or umbilicus or tickle his toes to encourage the child to look down. Look to see if the child can bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes.\n\nIf you still have not seen the child bend his neck himself, ask the mother to help you lie the child on his back. Lean over the child, gently support his back and shoulders with one hand. With the other hand, hold his head. Then carefully bend the head forward toward his chest. If the neck bends easily, the child does not have stiff neck. If the neck feels stiff and there is resistance to bending, the child has a stiff neck.

To palpate the abdomen, place the flat of your hand on the abdominal wall and apply a firm and steady pressure. Observe the child's facial expression during palpation to determine if they are in pain. For younger children who refuse to lay on his/her back or crying infants, examine the abdomen while the child is sitting on the mother's lap.
